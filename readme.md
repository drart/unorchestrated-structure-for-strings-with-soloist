Unorchestrated structure for strings and soloist
------------------------------------------------

A piece originally composed to be performed with the (Kingston Community Strings)[http://kingstoncommunitystrings.org/] in early 2016. I performed the piece as the soloist playing the (Madrona Labs Soundplane)[http://madronalabs.com/soundplane]. 

It is a bit of a mess, but hopefully is useful for people combining LaTeX and Lilypond without the lilypond-book integration. I have lost the links to the manuals and forums where I learned some of the tricks used in the parts. If some of this code comes from you please let me know so I can credit you accordingly.
